# Modifiable-Chess
Current Design Goals:
    1. rewrite code for neatness and beauty
    2. maintain modifiability for custom pieces, custom board dimensions, nonstandard players counts, alternate rule sets
    3. reduce reliance on error catching
    4. in general, make as few assumptions as possible about chess variant
